# Crypto and Digit Classifier Streamlit Apps

This repository houses three distinct Streamlit applications, each tailored for different functionalities revolving around cryptocurrency analytics and digit classification from images. The apps leverage data from CoinGecko API, provide comparative analytics between cryptocurrencies, and employ a TensorFlow Keras model for digit classification.

## Apps Overview

### 1. Coin Detail App

This application fetches cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API and displays a trend graph for the selected cryptocurrency over the past 52 weeks. Users can select any cryptocurrency listed on CoinGecko to view its performance trend.

### 2. Coin Comparison App

In this app, users can compare the performance of two cryptocurrencies over specified time frames (1 week, 1 month, 1 year, or 5 years). The app generates and displays a comparative graph based on the user's selection.

### 3. Image Digit Classifier

This application allows users to upload an image, and with the help of a preloaded TensorFlow Keras model, it predicts the number depicted in the image. This app is a showcase of machine learning model integration with Streamlit.
